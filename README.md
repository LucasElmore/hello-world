Hello World! I am Lucas Elmore, a CS student at Auburn University! I am interested in machine learning, AI,
aerospace technologies, and so many other things! I like all outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, 
canoeing, etc. I also like reading, playing video games, and watching Netflix. I love to learn new things.
